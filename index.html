    <div id="About"> <h2>Project Goal and Purpose</h2>
    <p>
        The primary goal of the Inventory App is to facilitate efficient tracking and management of items within a warehouse setting. It aims to streamline inventory-related tasks, improve accuracy, and enhance productivity for warehouse operations.
    </p>
    <h2>Major Components</h2>
    <p>
        To support the app's goals, the following major components are necessary:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Database Structure: At least two tables should be created â€” one for storing inventory items and another for user authentication (user logins and passwords).</li>
        <li>Login Screen: Implement a login screen allowing users to securely access the app, with the option to create a new account if they have not logged in before.</li>
        <li>Inventory Display: Design a screen with a grid layout that displays all items in the inventory, providing users with an organized view of available stock.</li>
        <li>Inventory Management Features: Implement mechanisms to add, remove, increase, and decrease the quantity of specific items in the inventory.</li>
        <li>Notification System: Develop a notification system that alerts users when the quantity of any item in the inventory has been reduced to zero, prompting timely restocking actions.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>User Interaction</h2>
    <p>
        Upon launching the app, users will be presented with a login screen where they can authenticate themselves or create a new account. After successful login, users will navigate to the main screen, which displays a grid layout of all inventory items. Users can interact with the grid to perform inventory management tasks such as adding, removing, and adjusting item quantities. The app will provide real-time updates on inventory changes and issue notifications when inventory levels reach critical thresholds.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Potential Users of the Application</h2>
    <p>
        Users
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Warehouse Managers: Oversee warehouse operations, requiring a comprehensive inventory management system to ensure efficient stock control, accurate tracking, and timely restocking.</li>
        <li>Inventory Clerks: Tasked with day-to-day inventory tasks such as receiving shipments, updating inventory records, and fulfilling orders. They need a user-friendly app to streamline these processes and minimize errors.</li>
        <li>Business Owners: Small to medium-sized business owners manage warehouse inventory. They require a reliable inventory management solution to monitor stock levels, track inventory movements, and optimize inventory turnover.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>User Needs and Engagement</h2>
    <p>
        Warehouse managers need real-time access to inventory data to make informed decisions and optimize warehouse operations. Inventory clerks require a simple yet effective tool to perform their daily tasks efficiently and accurately. Business owners seek a cost-effective solution to manage their inventory effectively, helping them maintain optimal stock levels and minimize costs.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Inventory App fits into users' lifestyles by providing a convenient and intuitive tool to manage warehouse inventory. It allows users to access critical inventory information anytime, anywhere. Users may engage with the app as needed based on their roles, with inventory clerks potentially spending more time interacting with the app during their daily tasks than warehouse managers and business owners.
